## Premise WebClient .NET Client Portable Class Library
*A .NET Portable Class Library (PCL) for accessing Premise from .NET.*

The **Premise WebClient .NET Client Library** makes it easy to build .NET apps that talk to Premise. It supports the entire [Premise WebClient Protocol](https://github.com/tig/Premise/blob/master/Premise%20WebClient%20Protocol.md) including subscriptions so polling is not needed. See README.md in that project for more details. 

This project should work for Windows Phone 7/8 apps, Windows RT apps, standard .NET apps, and Xamarin (iOS and Android) apps.
