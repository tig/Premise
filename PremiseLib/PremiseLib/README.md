Premise WebClient .NET Client Library
=======
*Copyright Â© 2013 Kindel Systems*

*A .NET library for accessing Premise from .NET.*

The **Premise WebClient .NET Client Library** makes it easy to build .NET apps that talk to Premise. It supports the entire [Premise WebClient Protocol](https://github.com/tig/Premise/blob/master/Premise%20Protocol%20Docs.md) including subscriptions so polling is not needed. See README.md in that project for more details.
