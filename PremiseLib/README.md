A command line tool illustrating using the Premise WebClient protocol from .NET.

This project includes the following:

* **Premise WebClient .NET Client Library** - A .NET library that should make it easy to build .NET apps that talk to Premise. Fully supports subscriptions so polling is not needed. See README.md in that project for more details. [Source](https://github.com/tig/Premise/tree/master/PremiseLib/Premise).
* **pr** - A simple command line tool that makes it easy to exercise the client library. [Source](https://github.com/tig/Premise/tree/master/PremiseLib/pr)
