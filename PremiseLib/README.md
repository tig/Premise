A command line tool illustrating using the Premise WebClient protocol from .NET.

This project includes the following:

* **Premise WebClient .NET Client Library** - A .NET library that should make it easy to build .NET apps that talk to Premise. Fully supports subscriptions so polling is not needed. [Read docs and access source here.](https://github.com/tig/Premise/tree/master/PremiseLib/PremiseLib).
* **pr** - A simple command line tool that makes it easy to exercise the client library. [Source](https://github.com/tig/Premise/tree/master/PremiseLib/pr)
